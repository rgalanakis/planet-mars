# Planet Mars configuration file

# This illustrates some of Planet's features with examples.
# All paths are relative to the Planet Mars root.

# Every planet needs a [Planet] section
[Planet]
# name: Your planet's name
# link: Link to the main page
# owner_name: Your name
# owner_email: Your e-mail address
# feed: Address of the preferred feed. Make sure there is a matching template!

# cache_directory: Where cached feeds are stored
# new_feed_items: Number of items to take from new feeds
# log_level: One of DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR or CRITICAL
# feed_timeout: number of seconds to wait for any given feed

# template_files: Space-separated list of output template files
#   Templating is done based on extension:
#   .html: Jinja2
#   .tmpl: htmltmpl
# Usually you only provide the index.html template and use the planet-supplied
#   templates for feed files.
# If a template begins with planet/template, it will use the included
#   planet templates. Otherwise, it will be from the CWD.
# Use forward slashes only.

# The following provide defaults for each template:
# output_dir: Directory to place output files.
#             Should contain web support files (css, etc).
# items_per_page: How many items to put on each page
# days_per_page: How many complete days of posts to put on each page
#                This is the absolute, hard limit (over the item limit)
# date_format: strftime format for the default 'date' template variable
# new_date_format: strftime format for the 'new_date' template variable
# encoding: output encoding for the file, Python 2.3+ users can use the
#           special "xml" value to output ASCII with XML character references
# locale: locale to use for (e.g.) strings in dates, default is taken from your
#         system. You can specify more locales separated by ':', planet will
#         use the first available one

[DEFAULT]
# Options placed in the [DEFAULT] section provide defaults for the feed
# sections.  Placing a default here means you only need to override the
# special cases.

# Any other section defines a feed to subscribe to.  The section title
# (in the []s) is the URI of the feed itself.  A section can
# have any option defined, which will be available in the template
# prefixed with channel_ for the Items loop.
